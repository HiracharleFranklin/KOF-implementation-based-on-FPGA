# KOF-implementation-based-on-FPGA
This project implements the classical video game Streetfighter on an FPGA board and SystemVerilog Language. Our design includes NIOS II SoC for interfacing with a USB Keyboard as the game controller to manage the keyboard input. The main game logic is supported by FSMs. The animation is done through a sequence of sprites controlled by an animation FSM. The background, sprites and music are stored in SRAM as buffers.
